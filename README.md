# E-commerce-Sales--Analysis
# 🛒 E-commerce Sales Analysis (Python + Pandas)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes an E-commerce dataset to understand **Sales, Profit, and Quantity trends**.  
The main goal of this project is to generate meaningful insights from the data such as:
- monthly performance trends
- category & region contribution
- low profit reasons (patterns)
- top performing and low performing products

This project is created as a **Data Analyst Portfolio Project**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze monthly KPI (Sales, Profit, Quantity)
- Find which regions/categories/products are performing well
- Identify possible reasons behind low profit

---

## 🧾 Dataset Columns
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Order Date**
- **Product Name**
- **Category**
- **Region**
- **Quantity**
- **Sales**
- **Profit**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
### ✅ 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked missing values
- Removed duplicates (if any)
- Converted `Order Date` into datetime format
- Created a new column for month-year analysis

### ✅ 2. Monthly KPI Analysis
Calculated monthly totals for:
- **Sales**
- **Profit**
- **Quantity**

### ✅ 3. Trend Visualizations
Created graphs such as:
- Sales trend by month
- Profit trend by month
- Quantity trend by month
- Comparison of KPI trends

### ✅ 4. Region-wise & Category-wise Analysis
- Total sales, profit, quantity by **Region**
- Total sales, profit, quantity by **Category**

### ✅ 5. Low Profit Investigation
- Checked which regions or categories contribute to low profit
- Identified products generating low profit / loss

---

## 📊 Sample Insights (Example)
- Some regions generate high sales but low profit.
- Certain products show repeated loss, affecting overall profit.
- Profit trends fluctuate month-to-month across regions/categories.

---

## ✅ These things will do to increase the profit based on the data
“If we increase Camera stock and promotions, overall profit will increase because Camera is the highest profit product.”

“If we expand in the West region, total profit will increase because West contributes the maximum profit.”

“If we boost Electronics inventory and marketing, overall sales will increase since Electronics is the top-selling category.”

“If we run offers in February, sales and profit will recover because February shows the biggest drop.”
